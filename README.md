# Machine Learning Project Template

This repository is structured as a template for a machine learning project. It is set up to facilitate data analysis, model training, and result reporting.

## Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and reports.
  - `exploratory`: Notebooks for initial data exploration.
  - `reports`: Finalized notebooks for sharing with stakeholders.

- `src/`: Source code for the machine learning project.
  - `data`: Scripts to download or generate data.
  - `features`: Scripts to convert raw data into features for modeling.
  - `models`: Model definitions and architectures.
  - `visualization`: Scripts for data and result visualizations.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions.
  - `main.py`: Main script to run the training and evaluation pipeline.

- `data/`: Data used in the project.
  - `raw/`: Immutable raw data.
  - `processed/`: Cleaned and preprocessed data.
  - `augmented/`: Data augmented through various techniques.

- `experiments/`: Tracking and configuration files for experiments.

- `models/`: Storage for trained models and summaries.

- `logs/`: Log files for various processes (e.g., training logs).

- `docs/`: Documentation related to the project.
  - `model_docs`: Information on model usage and reference.
  - `data_docs`: Details about the data pipeline.

- `requirements.txt`: Required packages for reproducing the analysis environment.

## Setup

To set up the project environment, run:

```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```

Replace `<env>` with your desired environment name.

## Usage

To run the main pipeline, execute:

```
python src/main.py
```

Ensure that you activate the conda environment before running the scripts.
